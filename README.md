pip install -r requirements.txt
# Done! now call the tool: ./holdleftclick.py
```

hold-left-click supports the following command-line arguments:

- `--wait`, `-w`: how many seconds to wait before starting (default: 3)
- `--interval`, `-i`: how much time to wait between mouse down action (default: 0.1)
- `--version`, `-V`: display version and exit
